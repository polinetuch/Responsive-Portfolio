        Female in coding? Yes, you are right! It is not something that you hear
        everyday, right? I would sit down and talk to you all day about my story
        and how I got into coding. I wish we had the time to do so!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, time is valuable so I am just going to get straight to
        the point. I have developed interest in coding after reading so many
        articles online about how amazing the current technology is!
      </p>
      <p>
        I ask myself questions everyday; how does this work, who create this
        program, where do you get the idea from or what does the behind the
        scene looks like to such an awesome app/program. Oh so many questions
        can a brain generate! Anyways, then I began trying it out online by
        myself. Oh my, there is so much more to coding that I want to know
        about. And here I am joining everybody else in the Monash Bootcamp.
